        <p>Looking for some iconic moments? Here’s a classic reminder of the “VOC mentaliteit” that sparked a lively debate in the Netherlands:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>📜 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBWtXvuKF_c">VOC Mentaliteit - Jan Peter Balkenende</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p><em>In 2006, Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende famously referenced the "VOC mentaliteit" in a debate, encouraging the Dutch to embrace an optimistic, dynamic spirit. Though some saw this as a nod to Dutch courage and innovation, others critiqued it as overlooking the darker aspects of the Dutch colonial past.</em></p>

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>Want to learn more about the Netherlands? Here are some fun and informative videos:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cIHLgGZByY">Why the Netherlands is Europe’s Most OP Country</a></li>
        <p>This video explores how the Netherlands, despite its small size, has become a global powerhouse. It highlights the nation’s strategic location in Europe, which channels massive trade through the Port of Rotterdam, one of the world’s busiest. The video also covers Dutch engineering marvels in land reclamation and water management, expanding usable land against the odds. The Netherlands’ impressive standing as a top global exporter of agricultural products is achieved through advanced, efficient farming practices. With substantial natural gas reserves and ASML’s pioneering role in chip manufacturing, the Netherlands punches above its weight in tech and resources. </p>
        
        <li> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELD2AwFN9Nc">America First, Netherlands Second</a></li>
        <p>When Donald Trump became president of the United States, Dutch comedy show <em>Zondag met Lubach</em> decided it was time to introduce the Netherlands in a way that would surely capture his attention. This humorous video, which went viral worldwide, presents the Netherlands as the perfect second choice after "America First." With a tone mimicking Trump’s style, the video covers everything from the “really, really great” Dutch dykes to their “awesome” tradition of Zwarte Piet. It’s a hilarious, tongue-in-cheek guide to the Netherlands, inviting Trump (and the world) to take a closer look at this small but mighty country!</p>
